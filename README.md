# Project Overview
The Email/SMS Spam Classifier uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a machine learning model to analyze and classify text messages. It helps users filter out unwanted spam messages effectively.

Key Steps:
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, removing stopwords).
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
Prediction using a trained machine learning model.

# Features
Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for simplicity and usability.
Real-time Spam Classification: Enter a message to instantly check if itâ€™s spam.
Machine Learning Model: Pretrained model for accurate classification.

# Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-folder>
Install dependencies: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed, then run:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK data: Ensure the required NLTK datasets are available:

bash
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords
Add the model and vectorizer files: Place the model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl files in the root directory.

# How to Run the App
Run the Streamlit application:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to:

arduino
http://localhost:8501
Input a message into the text box and click the "Predict" button to see the result.
